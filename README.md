# APITracker
Our project works to track data changes from a given API Request URL. Users provide an email address, Request URL, and desired time to theyâ€™d like the service to run the request and store / compare the data. If the data at the time of running the request has changed, we notify the user of the changes via email. Additionally, the user can login via a website and view their API Requests, edit, delete, and view all the tracked changes.
