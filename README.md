# APITracker
Our project works to track data changes from a given API Request URL. Users provide a request URL, and the desired time interval theyâ€™d like the service to run (in hours, with a minimum of 1 hour). The request is executed on that time interval and the data is compared with the last execution and stored id changes are found. Additionally, the user can login via a website and view their API Requests, edit, delete, and view all the tracked changes.
